 I am thrilled to announce that the Elephant Campaign team has reached the Ethiopia border in Moyale, a significant milestone in our journey.

 I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire team that accompanied me today: ACC Moyale, Mr. Martin Muhia; the KWS team led by Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha; OCPD Mr. George Kipkoros; AP Commander (PPU) Mr. Shadrack Yego; Deputy Officer in Charge of Moyale Prison, Mr. Kodeck Mose; Deputy OCS, Mr. Samora Bala; Subcounty AP Commander, Mr. Geoffrey Elongi; the KDF team led by Lieutenant Mr. M. Kassim; Border Liaison Officer, Major Ruto; the Peace Forum team led by Chair Mr. Mohamed; and the Dabel Conservancy team led by Mr. Ali Bule.

Walking through Moyale town and engaging with the residents was a powerful experience. It was an opportunity to share the message of conservation with the local community and to emphasize the importance of protecting our wildlife and environment. 

The presence of local leaders and security personnel made the day even more impactful, as it demonstrated a unified effort between different sectors of society—government, security forces, and conservationists—working together toward a common goal.

After the walk, I, along with KWS Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha, had the pleasure of inviting the entire team to the KWS camp for lunch. 

Sharing a meal together was more than just an act of hospitality; it was a moment to reflect on and celebrate the progress we have made so far in the Elephant Campaign Walk. It allowed us to  strengthen our bonds, and appreciate the collective effort that has brought us this far.

Eating together symbolizes unity and the importance of working as a team to achieve common goals. It was a time to not only celebrate our accomplishments but also to recharge and prepare for the journey ahead, knowing that every step we take is a step toward securing a future where both people and wildlife can thrive. @KWSKenya

During a breakfast at the Police Academy in Cairo, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi said Egypt doesn't ""support Somalia because of Ethiopia,"" adding, ""We support them because they have been in a state of instability for 30 years.""

El-Sisi's remarks follow reports of an Egyptian military shipment to #Mogadishu, which the media described as “the largest shipment of military aid.” The shipment reportedly included heavy artillery, anti-tank weapons, and armored vehicles.

Tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia have escalated after the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (#MoU) on 01 January between Ethiopia and #Somaliland. The MoU aims to grant Ethiopia access to the sea in exchange for the recognition of Somaliland, which Somalia opposes.

The delivery of military aid to Somalia is part of a bilateral defense pact signed between Egypt and Somalia in August 2024. Egypt had previously deployed military officers and equipment to Mogadishu, with media reports estimating that this could involve up to 10,000 Egyptian soldiers in Somalia.

El-Sisi also spoke about the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (#GERD), emphasizing Egypt's efforts to ""engage in discussions and use all political and diplomatic tools to safeguard its water rights in the Nile River,"" Ahram Online reported.",False,None,"Egypt,Somalia,Mogadishu,MoU,Somaliland,GERD",1841038138447147348,None,False,False,en,https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1841038057157390338/pu/img/o5jAxtXEENpJpOML.jpg,None,None,False,None,2,6,11,None,None,None,None,263074291,6225,EnabledWithCount

In these slums, people survive on less than a dollar a day, despite the country's strategic port generating billions in annual revenue from Ethiopia. However, rampant corruption ensures that these profits remain concentrated in the hands of the ruling elite, exacerbating the dire economic situation for most citizens.

Human rights abuses are pervasive. The government, led by President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh since 1999, regularly holds deeply flawed elections where Guelleh re-elects himself with impossibly high vote margins, often staged with decoy opponents. 

The regime is marked by brutal repression, political dissent is met with arbitrary arrests, torture, and indefinite detentions. Many of Guelleh’s political opponents have either fled the country or faced repeated imprisonment and torture upon their return. Freedom of the press is nonexistent, with the few independent media outlets either shuttered or severely curtailed. Even religious freedoms are restricted, and the government keeps tight control over both political and civil liberties.

Guelleh’s regime has masterfully obscured this grim reality from international scrutiny by funding friendly media outlets from Somalia, Somalia, Kenya and institutions to whitewash the situation. He bankrolls conferences and studies through think tanks like the Heritage Institute, aimed at legitimizing his rule while the people of Djibouti continue to languish in poverty. The international community, including Western nations, largely turns a blind eye to these atrocities because they maintain critical military bases in the country and prefer not to disrupt relations with the dictator.

The Amhara Education Bureau reports that only two million students have registered for the current academic year, falling short of the anticipated seven million enrollments. Parents and students in rural areas of Amhara have reported widespread school closures and educational disruptions due to security concerns.

Students from various districts described schools being closed, repurposed as military camps, or damaged in the conflict. The ongoing clashes between federal forces and non-state Fano militias have created a precarious security situation, impeding the development of infrastructure and essential services. This continues a trend from the previous year, when millions of students were unable to attend school due to the conflict.

Today, Djibouti continues to serve as a mediator, will taking over from Turkey in facilitating peace talks between Ethiopia and Somalia. Its geographical proximity to both countries allows it to bridge the gap and facilitate reconciliation efforts. As current leaders navigate complex relationships, Djibouti remains a crucial venue for discussions aimed at peaceful coexistence.

Ethiopia's history is deeply rooted in the strength of its military, which has always been more than just a force—it is an institution driven by a higher purpose. The Ethiopian military embodies sacrifice and commitment that go beyond the confines of individual villages, aiming instead at the broader mission of protecting and preserving the nation.

The challenges encountered by the National Defense Army at various levels have provided opportunities for growth and transformation. These difficulties have enabled the army to rebuild itself with enhanced standards and improved capabilities. It now possesses the potential to serve the nation with even greater dedication, commitment, and love.

Ethiopia sent a military warning to Egypt through Djibouti. The warning came in response to Egypt’s increasing military involvement in Somalia. On September 23, 2024, an Egyptian ship carrying military hardware, including anti-tank weapons and artillery, docked in Somalia. The vessel was escorted by Egypt’s stealth corvette, Segm Port Said. Upon receiving the shipment, the Somali Defense Minister said, “We know our interests, and we will choose between our allies and our enemies.” This marked the second delivery of military aid from Egypt to Somalia in just a few days.

In August, Egypt formalized a military agreement with Somalia, which Ethiopia sees as an apparent attempt to block its own interest for access to the sea via Somaliland. Ethiopia swiftly responded by sending a discreet but firm message through Djibouti, warning that any Egyptian military actions threatening Ethiopia's interests in Somalia would lead to serious consequences. Egypt has continued to ramp up its military presence, further escalating tensions in the already volatile Horn of Africa. This situation is part of a broader power struggle, with Egypt’s actions destabilizing not just Somalia but the entire region.

Located in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, this ancient rock-hewn church stands atop a vertical cliff, perched at an elevation of around 2,580 meters (8,460 feet). It is considered one of the most inaccessible and challenging religious sites to reach in the world.

The construction of rock-hewn churches in Ethiopia has a long history dating back to the 4th century AD, during the time of the Aksumite Empire. These churches were built by carving into solid rock formations, creating impressive architectural masterpieces. The rock-hewn churches served as centers of religious devotion and provided shelter during times of conflict.

Abuna Yemata Guh is believed to have been carved out of the cliff face during the 5th century, making it over 1,500 years old. It is dedicated to Saint Yemata, a legendary Ethiopian saint who is said to have meditated and prayed in this secluded location. The church is named after Abuna (meaning ""father"" in Amharic) Yemata, who was a prominent Ethiopian religious leader.

What makes Abuna Yemata Guh particularly notable is the challenging ascent required to reach it. Pilgrims and visitors must hike up a steep and narrow footpath, navigating rugged terrain and exposed ledges. The ascent involves scrambling up the cliff face, sometimes using ropes for support. This arduous journey symbolizes a spiritual pilgrimage, testing the devotion and commitment of those seeking solace and connection with their faith.

Despite its remote and inaccessible location, Abuna Yemata Guh has attracted attention in recent years as a testament to Ethiopia's rich cultural heritage and architectural prowess. It is not only a place of worship but also a symbol of the enduring faith and determination of the Ethiopian people.

Furthermore, the Tigray region, where Abuna Yemata Guh is situated, has witnessed significant historical and cultural events throughout the centuries. It has been a center of religious and political power, with various empires and kingdoms rising and falling in the region. Today, Tigray is home to a diverse population, including the Tigrayan people, who have their unique language, culture, and traditions.

In recent years, the Tigray region has faced challenging times due to internal conflicts and humanitarian crises, making access to sites like Abuna Yemata Guh more difficult. Nevertheless, the church continues to be a testament to Ethiopia's rich history and the resilience of its people, reminding us of the enduring power of faith and the importance of preserving cultural heritage.",False,None,,1673837658995322885,None,False,False,en,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FzqqZUyXsAApbuc.jpg,None,None,False,None,468,609,7245,None,None,None,None,855481986290524160,12873864,EnabledWithCount

The Amhara Education Bureau reports that only two million students have registered for the current academic year, falling short of the anticipated seven million enrollments. Parents and students in rural areas of Amhara have reported widespread school closures and educational disruptions due to security concerns.

Students from various districts described schools being closed, repurposed as military camps, or damaged in the conflict. The ongoing clashes between federal forces and non-state Fano militias have created a precarious security situation, impeding the development of infrastructure and essential services. This continues a trend from the previous year, when millions of students were unable to attend school due to the conflict.

One of the leaders of the Amhara Fano in Gojam, Asres Mare, recently revealed alarming details on his social media. He reports that the oppressive regime of Abiy Ahmed, having faced repeated military defeats, is now employing terroristic tactics by abducting innocent civilians from cities and detaining them in these camps.

The regime has issued directives to remove regional police and security forces from major cities, including Bahir Dar, and replace them with a covert force disguised as federal police. This plan is set to take effect immediately, with around 200 members of this repressive unit already deployed in Bahir Dar. Innocent civilians are being targeted for abduction, and even regional police officers have become victims of this crackdown.

We urgently call on the international community to recognize and act against these grave human rights violations. These actions are the hallmark of state-sponsored terrorism and are leading to the imprisonment of innocent people in secret #AmharaConcentrationCamps. The silence of the world will only embolden this regime. Immediate intervention is needed to stop these atrocities and protect the Amhara civilians from further persecution.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a former member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front, an organization still classified as a terrorist group by the United States, and current Director of the World Health Organization (WHO), has proposed a contentious initiative. 

https://t.co/XTHWs0PXde

The WHO plans to establish a global enforcement body tasked with penalizing individuals who disseminate content on the Internet that deviates from mainstream narratives.

During a session named ""Disease X,"" Tedros emphasized the necessity for global preparedness and understanding of potential future pandemics. He advocated for the adoption of the WHO's 'Pandemic Agreement' by world leaders, which he believes is crucial for this purpose. 

This agreement, if ratified, would confer extraordinary powers on the WHO over sovereign states. It includes provisions that could potentially curtail free speech and result in the incarceration of individuals accused of spreading what is deemed as 'misinformation' online. This plan has sparked debate over its implications for individual freedoms and national sovereignty.

The Nine Saints are said to have come to Ethiopia from various regions, including Rome, Constantinople, and Syria, to spread Christianity and establish a monastic tradition. The paintings in the church are original and have been well-preserved due to the dry air and lack of humidity.

To access the church, one must climb a steep cliff with hand and feet holes carved into it. The ascent is considered hazardous and requires both physical strength and mental fortitude.

---
Adigrat, a town in Eastern Tigray, buzzes with vibrant celebration for a holiday locally known as Meskel, the Finding of the True Cross which is celebrated on September 27. Meskel festivities commenced in Adigrat on the eve of the holiday, drawing thousands of residents and visitors to public squares and churches in which bonfires were built topped by a Cross to which flowers and bundles of tied-up twigs and sticks, known as Shig are tied.  

Today, the celebration began early in the morning with a procession led by clergymen and priests organizing special services, featuring hymns and prayers dedicated to the significance of the Cross in Orthodox Christian faith. The celebration took place in the presence of Getachew Reda, President of the Interim Administration in Tigrai along with his Deputy, Lt General Tsadkan Gebretinsae, Arch Bishop of the Eastern Tigray Diocese, and Head of Tigrai Culture and Tourism Bureau, Atsbeha Gebregzabher. 

Speaking at the celebration, Getachew emphasized on the need to fully address all the challanges of the people of Tigray, urging politicians to move beyond personal and group interests and start advocating for substantial political change that empowers the younger generation to engage in meaningful and constructive activities. 

During his address at the celebration, Archbishop Abune Ephrem stressed on the importance of unity and reconcilation in preserving the rich cultural and religious practices of Mesqel before orchestrating the lightning ceremony. 

Residents and visitors in Adigrat continue to enjoy the lively Meskel celebrations. Attendees are indulging in traditional dishes like Gi-ezm and Tihlo, which are particularly favored during this festive time.

We Oromos will lead this resource rich country and fix it. Any Oromo that opposes this point of view is a traitor and we will wipe them out."" ~ Field Marshal Berhanu Jula, Chief of Staff of the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF)

This was an impromptu speech made by Field Marshal Berhanu Jula two days ago (September 24, 2024) where he boasts about Oromo dominance and control over Ethiopia. He asserts that the Oromo are the rightful rulers of Ethiopia and claims that the Oromo have liberated themselves from oppression and now own the country. He states that enemies from different directions are rising up on Oromos, now that Oromos are ruling #Ethiopia at the top.

This is the mindset of the man who is leading the Ethiopian National Defense Force in its genocidal #WarOnAmhara for over a year.

Full Translation of Speech:

""Oromo is now ruling over Ethiopia, any Oromo who opposes this government is a traitor and we will eliminate them. We are the ones who created Ethiopia, and we are the ones who maintained Ethiopia. Through our struggle we have broken the chains that enslaved us and have freed ourselves. Oromo is again in power. Oromo are a great people who founded Ethiopia and brought Ethiopia to where it is today but even after doing this Oromo were never respected. Oromo have many heroes, these heroes founded this country and brought her to where she is now. As for us, we have broken the chains that had bound us through our struggle and have freed ourselves. Now we have the ownership of the country. We Oromos will lead this resource rich country and fix it. Any Oromo that opposes this point of view is a traitor and we will wipe them out. Our right is now respected, and we will slowly fix any issues. The people (Oromo) know this and that is why they are waiting patiently. The others (OLA) have to come to their senses and stop dividing the people. Every Oromo cares for every Oromo. Any Oromo that stands against Oromo is a traitor. Right when Oromo get our share and start ruling Ethiopia at the top, enemies from different directions are rising up on us. They'll disappear when we eliminate our traitors (OLA)."" ~ Field Marshal Berhanu Jula, Chief of Staff of the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF)",False,None,"Ethiopia,WarOnAmhara",1839180365099053108,None,True,False,en,https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1839178134991552512/pu/img/gasdBoXG1WSPsXGX.jpg,None,None,False,1735407763587489867,30,43,102,None,None,None,None,2718472203,89641,EnabledWithCount

 I am thrilled to announce that the Elephant Campaign team has reached the Ethiopia border in Moyale, a significant milestone in our journey.

 I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire team that accompanied me today: ACC Moyale, Mr. Martin Muhia; the KWS team led by Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha; OCPD Mr. George Kipkoros; AP Commander (PPU) Mr. Shadrack Yego; Deputy Officer in Charge of Moyale Prison, Mr. Kodeck Mose; Deputy OCS, Mr. Samora Bala; Subcounty AP Commander, Mr. Geoffrey Elongi; the KDF team led by Lieutenant Mr. M. Kassim; Border Liaison Officer, Major Ruto; the Peace Forum team led by Chair Mr. Mohamed; and the Dabel Conservancy team led by Mr. Ali Bule.

Walking through Moyale town and engaging with the residents was a powerful experience. It was an opportunity to share the message of conservation with the local community and to emphasize the importance of protecting our wildlife and environment. 

The presence of local leaders and security personnel made the day even more impactful, as it demonstrated a unified effort between different sectors of society—government, security forces, and conservationists—working together toward a common goal.

After the walk, I, along with KWS Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha, had the pleasure of inviting the entire team to the KWS camp for lunch. 

Sharing a meal together was more than just an act of hospitality; it was a moment to reflect on and celebrate the progress we have made so far in the Elephant Campaign Walk. It allowed us to  strengthen our bonds, and appreciate the collective effort that has brought us this far.

Eating together symbolizes unity and the importance of working as a team to achieve common goals. It was a time to not only celebrate our accomplishments but also to recharge and prepare for the journey ahead, knowing that every step we take is a step toward securing a future where both people and wildlife can thrive. @KWSKenya

The Amhara Education Bureau reports that only two million students have registered for the current academic year, falling short of the anticipated seven million enrollments. Parents and students in rural areas of Amhara have reported widespread school closures and educational disruptions due to security concerns.

Students from various districts described schools being closed, repurposed as military camps, or damaged in the conflict. The ongoing clashes between federal forces and non-state Fano militias have created a precarious security situation, impeding the development of infrastructure and essential services. This continues a trend from the previous year, when millions of students were unable to attend school due to the conflict.

I was adopted by my father’s sister, a Christian. 
Throughout my childhood I always knew I was Jewish, and dreamt of one day moving to Israel. 
Around the age of 18 (I never knew my birthday), I decided to fulfill my mother’s dream and finally move to Israel.
I came here all on my own. After two years in Israel, I joined the army. The day I put on my uniform for the first time was one of the proudest days of my life. At that moment, I knew I made it. 
My dream is to help other orphans like myself. I know how hard it is to grow up without parents, and how important it is to have supportive people by your side. But if you believe in yourself and work hard - nothing can stop you.”

An Orthodox Christian priest named Priest Iyesus Ayalew, his wife and three children were horrifically killed in the Oromo Region, East Shoa zone, Lome district. The perpetrators are reported to be agents of an underground group known as Koree Nageenyaa that is covertly managed by the Oromo Prosperity Party led Ethiopian regime forces. This group has been targeting ethnic Amharas in a coordinated manner across the so-called Oromo Region and beyond in Ethiopia. 

GPE Note: Koree Nageenyaa (1)  is yet another underground group used to wage genocide against #Amharas, alongside, Gachena Sirna (a militia managed by the Oromo Regional officials and is tasked with protecting the Abaa Gadaa and other traditional Oromo governance systems), and other unspecified militia groups. These underground groups are known to coordinate with State forces like the Oromo Special Regional Force, the Ethiopian National Defense Force and the Ethiopia Federal Police as well as resistance groups like the Oromo Liberation Army.

 I am thrilled to announce that the Elephant Campaign team has reached the Ethiopia border in Moyale, a significant milestone in our journey.

 I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire team that accompanied me today: ACC Moyale, Mr. Martin Muhia; the KWS team led by Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha; OCPD Mr. George Kipkoros; AP Commander (PPU) Mr. Shadrack Yego; Deputy Officer in Charge of Moyale Prison, Mr. Kodeck Mose; Deputy OCS, Mr. Samora Bala; Subcounty AP Commander, Mr. Geoffrey Elongi; the KDF team led by Lieutenant Mr. M. Kassim; Border Liaison Officer, Major Ruto; the Peace Forum team led by Chair Mr. Mohamed; and the Dabel Conservancy team led by Mr. Ali Bule.

Walking through Moyale town and engaging with the residents was a powerful experience. It was an opportunity to share the message of conservation with the local community and to emphasize the importance of protecting our wildlife and environment. 

The presence of local leaders and security personnel made the day even more impactful, as it demonstrated a unified effort between different sectors of society—government, security forces, and conservationists—working together toward a common goal.

After the walk, I, along with KWS Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha, had the pleasure of inviting the entire team to the KWS camp for lunch. 

Sharing a meal together was more than just an act of hospitality; it was a moment to reflect on and celebrate the progress we have made so far in the Elephant Campaign Walk. It allowed us to  strengthen our bonds, and appreciate the collective effort that has brought us this far.

Eating together symbolizes unity and the importance of working as a team to achieve common goals. It was a time to not only celebrate our accomplishments but also to recharge and prepare for the journey ahead, knowing that every step we take is a step toward securing a future where both people and wildlife can thrive. @KWSKenya

The Amhara Education Bureau reports that only two million students have registered for the current academic year, falling short of the anticipated seven million enrollments. Parents and students in rural areas of Amhara have reported widespread school closures and educational disruptions due to security concerns.

Students from various districts described schools being closed, repurposed as military camps, or damaged in the conflict. The ongoing clashes between federal forces and non-state Fano militias have created a precarious security situation, impeding the development of infrastructure and essential services. This continues a trend from the previous year, when millions of students were unable to attend school due to the conflict.

I was adopted by my father’s sister, a Christian. 
Throughout my childhood I always knew I was Jewish, and dreamt of one day moving to Israel. 
Around the age of 18 (I never knew my birthday), I decided to fulfill my mother’s dream and finally move to Israel.
I came here all on my own. After two years in Israel, I joined the army. The day I put on my uniform for the first time was one of the proudest days of my life. At that moment, I knew I made it.

In these slums, people survive on less than a dollar a day, despite the country's strategic port generating billions in annual revenue from Ethiopia. However, rampant corruption ensures that these profits remain concentrated in the hands of the ruling elite, exacerbating the dire economic situation for most citizens.

Human rights abuses are pervasive. The government, led by President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh since 1999, regularly holds deeply flawed elections where Guelleh re-elects himself with impossibly high vote margins, often staged with decoy opponents. 

The regime is marked by brutal repression, political dissent is met with arbitrary arrests, torture, and indefinite detentions. Many of Guelleh’s political opponents have either fled the country or faced repeated imprisonment and torture upon their return. Freedom of the press is nonexistent, with the few independent media outlets either shuttered or severely curtailed. Even religious freedoms are restricted, and the government keeps tight control over both political and civil liberties.

Guelleh’s regime has masterfully obscured this grim reality from international scrutiny by funding friendly media outlets from Somalia, Somalia, Kenya and institutions to whitewash the situation. He bankrolls conferences and studies through think tanks like the Heritage Institute, aimed at legitimizing his rule while the people of Djibouti continue to languish in poverty. The international community, including Western nations, largely turns a blind eye to these atrocities because they maintain critical military bases in the country and prefer not to disrupt relations with the dictator.

The September 30 report emphasizes that the prevailing insecurity is “imposing restrictions on movement and obstructing access to health facilities.” The agency also noted an “alarming increase in abductions, killings, and sexual gender-based violence,” complicating essential health service delivery.

Additionally, the region is facing a rise in malaria cases and cholera outbreaks. Between January and September 2024, Ethiopia reported over 5.9 million malaria cases, with Amhara accounting for 17%. The WHO stated that, in a “volatile and unpredictable security context,” health partners are finding “alternative ways to access health facilities to deliver life-saving interventions” amid the cholera and malaria outbreaks.

A study by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) suggests that Ethiopia could experience a 0.6% reduction in GDP due to the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which is set to take effect in December 2024. The regulation is designed to ensure commodities like coffee are deforestation-free, posing challenges for Ethiopia’s coffee sector, which accounts for 30-35% of the country's total export revenues. 

The ODI highlights that the regulation could result in an 18.4% decline in exports and challenges for small-scale farmers. Ethiopia has requested an extension to meet the new requirements, noting that additional time is needed to align with the EUDR compliance measures.

Hargeisa, Somaliland – President of the Republic of Somaliland, H.E. Muse Bihi Abdi, announced that Somaliland and #Ethiopia are determined to move forward with the implementation of their recently agreed-upon bilateral accord. While he confirmed that the agreement will be put into effect, he refrained from specifying a timeline for its execution.

In an interview with Al Arabiya TV, a Gulf-based news network, and monitored by the Somaliland News Agency (SOLNA), President Bihi expressed confidence that Somaliland will gain international recognition, whether in the near or distant future.

Discussing the agreement with Ethiopia, President Bihi emphasized that it promises significant economic benefits for the Horn of Africa. As part of the accord, Ethiopia has agreed to recognize Somaliland’s independence and, in return, will lease a naval base from Somaliland. He described the agreement as a partnership based on mutual interests.

The president also highlighted strong domestic support for the agreement, stating that both the people of Somaliland and its political leadership see the deal with Ethiopia as crucial for Somaliland’s future.

Reflecting on the historical context, President Bihi noted that Somaliland and Somalia were once two independent nations that united in 1960. However, that union collapsed after 31 years, following a period of conflict and genocide against the people of Somaliland. He recalled that in 1991, Somaliland's elders convened a national conference to reclaim the country’s independence, reaffirming Somaliland’s statehood based on the will of its people, who remain committed to their sovereignty.

The president further remarked on Somalia’s continued recognition by Arab League nations, which he criticized for ignoring Somaliland. He expressed frustration with these countries for publicly stating that ""Somaliland is not recognized"" while failing to engage with the region.

President Bihi also emphasized Somaliland’s long-standing efforts to secure its independence over the past 34 years. He contrasted Somaliland’s stability with the ongoing turmoil and security issues in Somalia, where militant groups like Al-Shabaab and ISIS continue to operate. He affirmed that Somaliland’s coastline remains free of piracy and terrorism and open for global trade. 

The president vowed that Somaliland would defend itself should Somalia attempt any form of aggression.

In response to a question regarding Somaliland’s recent closure of Egypt’s cultural center, President Bihi explained that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi had spoken of restoring the “unity of Somalia.” Bihi dismissed this claim, suggesting that President el-Sisi should be asked to clarify what he meant by a “unified Somalia.”

Finally, President Bihi addressed the delay in Somaliland’s elections, acknowledging that his five-year term had expired and the presidential election was two years overdue. He expressed optimism that the elections, scheduled for November 13, 2024, would proceed peacefully, ensuring that the people of Somaliland can freely choose their next leader.",False,None,"Somaliland,Ethiopia",1837877578532577375,None,False,False,en,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYFz6fVWkAExxTP.jpg,None,None,False,None,5,10,43,None,None,None,None,1193169594183307265,6085,EnabledWithCount

 I am thrilled to announce that the Elephant Campaign team has reached the Ethiopia border in Moyale, a significant milestone in our journey.

 I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire team that accompanied me today: ACC Moyale, Mr. Martin Muhia; the KWS team led by Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha; OCPD Mr. George Kipkoros; AP Commander (PPU) Mr. Shadrack Yego; Deputy Officer in Charge of Moyale Prison, Mr. Kodeck Mose; Deputy OCS, Mr. Samora Bala; Subcounty AP Commander, Mr. Geoffrey Elongi; the KDF team led by Lieutenant Mr. M. Kassim; Border Liaison Officer, Major Ruto; the Peace Forum team led by Chair Mr. Mohamed; and the Dabel Conservancy team led by Mr. Ali Bule.

Walking through Moyale town and engaging with the residents was a powerful experience. It was an opportunity to share the message of conservation with the local community and to emphasize the importance of protecting our wildlife and environment. 

The presence of local leaders and security personnel made the day even more impactful, as it demonstrated a unified effort between different sectors of society—government, security forces, and conservationists—working together toward a common goal.

After the walk, I, along with KWS Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha, had the pleasure of inviting the entire team to the KWS camp for lunch. 

Sharing a meal together was more than just an act of hospitality; it was a moment to reflect on and celebrate the progress we have made so far in the Elephant Campaign Walk. It allowed us to  strengthen our bonds, and appreciate the collective effort that has brought us this far.

Eating together symbolizes unity and the importance of working as a team to achieve common goals. It was a time to not only celebrate our accomplishments but also to recharge and prepare for the journey ahead, knowing that every step we take is a step toward securing a future where both people and wildlife can thrive. @KWSKenya

The Amhara Education Bureau reports that only two million students have registered for the current academic year, falling short of the anticipated seven million enrollments. Parents and students in rural areas of Amhara have reported widespread school closures and educational disruptions due to security concerns.

Students from various districts described schools being closed, repurposed as military camps, or damaged in the conflict. The ongoing clashes between federal forces and non-state Fano militias have created a precarious security situation, impeding the development of infrastructure and essential services. This continues a trend from the previous year, when millions of students were unable to attend school due to the conflict.

In these slums, people survive on less than a dollar a day, despite the country's strategic port generating billions in annual revenue from Ethiopia. However, rampant corruption ensures that these profits remain concentrated in the hands of the ruling elite, exacerbating the dire economic situation for most citizens.

Human rights abuses are pervasive. The government, led by President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh since 1999, regularly holds deeply flawed elections where Guelleh re-elects himself with impossibly high vote margins, often staged with decoy opponents. 

The regime is marked by brutal repression, political dissent is met with arbitrary arrests, torture, and indefinite detentions. Many of Guelleh’s political opponents have either fled the country or faced repeated imprisonment and torture upon their return. Freedom of the press is nonexistent, with the few independent media outlets either shuttered or severely curtailed. Even religious freedoms are restricted, and the government keeps tight control over both political and civil liberties.

Guelleh’s regime has masterfully obscured this grim reality from international scrutiny by funding friendly media outlets from Somalia, Somalia, Kenya and institutions to whitewash the situation. He bankrolls conferences and studies through think tanks like the Heritage Institute, aimed at legitimizing his rule while the people of Djibouti continue to languish in poverty. The international community, including Western nations, largely turns a blind eye to these atrocities because they maintain critical military bases in the country and prefer not to disrupt relations with the dictator.

As it will be recalled, US Senator Chris Coons, and, his ilk and minions, had floated preposterous allegations accusing Eritrea of perpetrating “gross atrocities” in the war that raged for two years in northern Ethiopia.

These cheap and deplorable acts were prompted by malicious and entrenched policies of fomenting division to exacerbate and further compound the prevalent war.

These wicked and hollow ploys are being resuscitated these days under different forms and variants.

Eritrea will not be drawn, as ever, into mendacious acrimonies, fully aware as it is, of the moral bankruptcy and underlying ulterior agendas of the whole gimmick.

The September 30 report emphasizes that the prevailing insecurity is “imposing restrictions on movement and obstructing access to health facilities.” The agency also noted an “alarming increase in abductions, killings, and sexual gender-based violence,” complicating essential health service delivery.

Additionally, the region is facing a rise in malaria cases and cholera outbreaks. Between January and September 2024, Ethiopia reported over 5.9 million malaria cases, with Amhara accounting for 17%. The WHO stated that, in a “volatile and unpredictable security context,” health partners are finding “alternative ways to access health facilities to deliver life-saving interventions” amid the cholera and malaria outbreaks.

 I am thrilled to announce that the Elephant Campaign team has reached the Ethiopia border in Moyale, a significant milestone in our journey.

 I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire team that accompanied me today: ACC Moyale, Mr. Martin Muhia; the KWS team led by Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha; OCPD Mr. George Kipkoros; AP Commander (PPU) Mr. Shadrack Yego; Deputy Officer in Charge of Moyale Prison, Mr. Kodeck Mose; Deputy OCS, Mr. Samora Bala; Subcounty AP Commander, Mr. Geoffrey Elongi; the KDF team led by Lieutenant Mr. M. Kassim; Border Liaison Officer, Major Ruto; the Peace Forum team led by Chair Mr. Mohamed; and the Dabel Conservancy team led by Mr. Ali Bule.

Walking through Moyale town and engaging with the residents was a powerful experience. It was an opportunity to share the message of conservation with the local community and to emphasize the importance of protecting our wildlife and environment. 

The presence of local leaders and security personnel made the day even more impactful, as it demonstrated a unified effort between different sectors of society—government, security forces, and conservationists—working together toward a common goal.

After the walk, I, along with KWS Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha, had the pleasure of inviting the entire team to the KWS camp for lunch. 

Sharing a meal together was more than just an act of hospitality; it was a moment to reflect on and celebrate the progress we have made so far in the Elephant Campaign Walk. It allowed us to  strengthen our bonds, and appreciate the collective effort that has brought us this far.

Eating together symbolizes unity and the importance of working as a team to achieve common goals. It was a time to not only celebrate our accomplishments but also to recharge and prepare for the journey ahead, knowing that every step we take is a step toward securing a future where both people and wildlife can thrive. @KWSKenya

 I am thrilled to announce that the Elephant Campaign team has reached the Ethiopia border in Moyale, a significant milestone in our journey.

 I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire team that accompanied me today: ACC Moyale, Mr. Martin Muhia; the KWS team led by Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha; OCPD Mr. George Kipkoros; AP Commander (PPU) Mr. Shadrack Yego; Deputy Officer in Charge of Moyale Prison, Mr. Kodeck Mose; Deputy OCS, Mr. Samora Bala; Subcounty AP Commander, Mr. Geoffrey Elongi; the KDF team led by Lieutenant Mr. M. Kassim; Border Liaison Officer, Major Ruto; the Peace Forum team led by Chair Mr. Mohamed; and the Dabel Conservancy team led by Mr. Ali Bule.

Walking through Moyale town and engaging with the residents was a powerful experience. It was an opportunity to share the message of conservation with the local community and to emphasize the importance of protecting our wildlife and environment. 

The presence of local leaders and security personnel made the day even more impactful, as it demonstrated a unified effort between different sectors of society—government, security forces, and conservationists—working together toward a common goal.

After the walk, I, along with KWS Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha, had the pleasure of inviting the entire team to the KWS camp for lunch. 

Sharing a meal together was more than just an act of hospitality; it was a moment to reflect on and celebrate the progress we have made so far in the Elephant Campaign Walk. It allowed us to  strengthen our bonds, and appreciate the collective effort that has brought us this far.

Eating together symbolizes unity and the importance of working as a team to achieve common goals. It was a time to not only celebrate our accomplishments but also to recharge and prepare for the journey ahead, knowing that every step we take is a step toward securing a future where both people and wildlife can thrive. @KWSKenya
