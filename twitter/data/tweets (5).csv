Africans everywhere have a responsibility to defend Niger at this moment. Why so? Well, Niger is the first African country to expel US Africa Command (AFRICOM) and to forge a sovereign path with two neighbours, Burkina Faso and Mali. The three countries recently ousted Western-aligned leaders and booted the French military. They also make up the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) confederation. This new anti-imperialist bloc shares defence, economic and foreign policies, and has agreed to issue a joint passport.

In this clip from a recent episode of ‘This Week in Africa,’ African Stream’s livestream collaboration with @authentic_african, Inemesit Richardson says Africans around the world must fight to defend the AES, as they have placed their hopes in the decolonial revolutionary process underway in Africa’s Sahel, an arid region south of the Sahara Desert.

But, Western powers are not happy about this revolutionary turn of events in Africa. For example, in May, just a few months after Niger tore up a military cooperation agreement with the United States and a few weeks before the US agreed to leave Niger by 15 September, Republican US Congressmember Matt Gaetz called for the US to invade the country. While nothing of the like unfolded, it does not mean that US regime-change tactics are off the table.

I was adopted by my father’s sister, a Christian.

Around the age of 18 (I never knew my birthday), I decided to fulfill my mother’s dream and finally move to Israel.
I came here all on my own. After two years in Israel, I joined the army. The day I put on my uniform for the first time was one of the proudest days of my life. At that moment, I knew I made it.

 I am thrilled to announce that the Elephant Campaign team has reached the Ethiopia border in Moyale, a significant milestone in our journey.

 I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire team that accompanied me today: ACC Moyale, Mr. Martin Muhia; the KWS team led by Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha; OCPD Mr. George Kipkoros; AP Commander (PPU) Mr. Shadrack Yego; Deputy Officer in Charge of Moyale Prison, Mr. Kodeck Mose; Deputy OCS, Mr. Samora Bala; Subcounty AP Commander, Mr. Geoffrey Elongi; the KDF team led by Lieutenant Mr. M. Kassim; Border Liaison Officer, Major Ruto; the Peace Forum team led by Chair Mr. Mohamed; and the Dabel Conservancy team led by Mr. Ali Bule.

Walking through Moyale town and engaging with the residents was a powerful experience. It was an opportunity to share the message of conservation with the local community and to emphasize the importance of protecting our wildlife and environment. 

The presence of local leaders and security personnel made the day even more impactful, as it demonstrated a unified effort between different sectors of society—government, security forces, and conservationists—working together toward a common goal.

After the walk, I, along with KWS Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha, had the pleasure of inviting the entire team to the KWS camp for lunch. 

Sharing a meal together was more than just an act of hospitality; it was a moment to reflect on and celebrate the progress we have made so far in the Elephant Campaign Walk. It allowed us to  strengthen our bonds, and appreciate the collective effort that has brought us this far.

Eating together symbolizes unity and the importance of working as a team to achieve common goals. It was a time to not only celebrate our accomplishments but also to recharge and prepare for the journey ahead, knowing that every step we take is a step toward securing a future where both people and wildlife can thrive. @KWSKenya

Africans on the continent and in the diaspora have always worked together and fought alongside one another for common goals.  When, on this day in 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia for a second time, thousands of Africans at home and abroad mobilised to fight the colonialists.  Black Harlemites in the United States, South Africans, Jamaicans and many others were clear on their mission:  it was time to defend Ethiopia at all costs.

For the Italians, the war was not merely payback for that humiliating defeat 40 years earlier, but a chance to implement dictator Benito Mussolini’s plan to inflate Italy's standing on the world stage.  However, for millions, the invasion imperiled Black freedom and dignity across the globe and awakened a strong sense of allegiance that transcended national boundaries.

Today, we see three countries in the Africa - Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger - defending African freedom and self-determination on the world stage and, like Ethiopia at the time, refusing to be colonised.  Yet these three countries are under brutal attack.  From terrorist paramilitaries to sanctions to coup attempts to Western media propaganda, the goal of Western powers is very clear:  they want to destroy the Alliance of Sahel States.

 I am thrilled to announce that the Elephant Campaign team has reached the Ethiopia border in Moyale, a significant milestone in our journey.

 I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire team that accompanied me today: ACC Moyale, Mr. Martin Muhia; the KWS team led by Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha; OCPD Mr. George Kipkoros; AP Commander (PPU) Mr. Shadrack Yego; Deputy Officer in Charge of Moyale Prison, Mr. Kodeck Mose; Deputy OCS, Mr. Samora Bala; Subcounty AP Commander, Mr. Geoffrey Elongi; the KDF team led by Lieutenant Mr. M. Kassim; Border Liaison Officer, Major Ruto; the Peace Forum team led by Chair Mr. Mohamed; and the Dabel Conservancy team led by Mr. Ali Bule.

Walking through Moyale town and engaging with the residents was a powerful experience. It was an opportunity to share the message of conservation with the local community and to emphasize the importance of protecting our wildlife and environment. 

The presence of local leaders and security personnel made the day even more impactful, as it demonstrated a unified effort between different sectors of society—government, security forces, and conservationists—working together toward a common goal.

After the walk, I, along with KWS Warden Mr. Abdi Kampicha, had the pleasure of inviting the entire team to the KWS camp for lunch. 

Sharing a meal together was more than just an act of hospitality; it was a moment to reflect on and celebrate the progress we have made so far in the Elephant Campaign Walk. It allowed us to  strengthen our bonds, and appreciate the collective effort that has brought us this far.

Eating together symbolizes unity and the importance of working as a team to achieve common goals. It was a time to not only celebrate our accomplishments but also to recharge and prepare for the journey ahead, knowing that every step we take is a step toward securing a future where both people and wildlife can thrive. @KWSKenya

Africans on the continent and in the diaspora have always worked together and fought alongside one another for common goals.  When, on this day in 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia for a second time, thousands of Africans at home and abroad mobilised to fight the colonialists.  Black Harlemites in the United States, South Africans, Jamaicans and many others were clear on their mission:  it was time to defend Ethiopia at all costs.

For the Italians, the war was not merely payback for that humiliating defeat 40 years earlier, but a chance to implement dictator Benito Mussolini’s plan to inflate Italy's standing on the world stage.  However, for millions, the invasion imperiled Black freedom and dignity across the globe and awakened a strong sense of allegiance that transcended national boundaries.

Today, we see three countries in the Africa - Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger - defending African freedom and self-determination on the world stage and, like Ethiopia at the time, refusing to be colonised.  Yet these three countries are under brutal attack.  From terrorist paramilitaries to sanctions to coup attempts to Western media propaganda, the goal of Western powers is very clear:  they want to destroy the Alliance of Sahel States.

attempting to move her to a new location when a pride of lions heard her cries for and rushed in.

The three lions chased off the men and sat quietly with the girl until the police arrived, then disappeared back into the brush. 

""They stood guard until we found her and then they just left her like a gift and went back into the forest,"" said
Sergeant Wondmu Wedaj. 

She told the authorities that while her kidnappers had beaten her, the
animals had never threatened her.

2 May, 1889

The Treaty of Wuchale, between Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia and Italy, deciding the territories of Eritrea and Northern Ethiopia was signed.

Treaty of Wuchale (or, Treaty of Ucciale; in Italian, Trattato di Uccialli) was a treaty signed by King Menelik II of Shewa, later the Emperor of Ethiopia with Count Pietro Antonelli of Italy in the town of Wuchale, Ethiopia, on 2 May 1889. The treaty ceded territories that had previously been a part of the empire, namely parts of the provinces of Bogos, Hamasien, Akkele Guzay, and Serae. This set forth the origins of the Italian colony of Eritrea and ending up a century later with modern state of Eritrea. In return, Italy promised financial assistance and military supplies that included 30,000 muskets and 28 cannons.
Disputes over Article 17 regarding the conduct of foreign affairs led to the First Italo–Ethiopian War culminating in the Battle of Adwa (https://t.co/6ZNYA6jSvx). The Italian version stated that Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities, in effect making Ethiopia an Italian protectorate, while the Amharic version gave Ethiopia considerable autonomy, with the option of communicating with third powers through the Italians. The misunderstanding was due to the mistranslation of a verb, which formed a permissive clause in A
mharic and a mandatory one in Italian.

Governor Mamo Mihretu stated, “Ethiopia’s foreign exchange reform has made a remarkably positive start within just two months.” He added that foreign exchange reserves have ""reached record levels"" following reforms. The sale is part of a broader plan to cover all fuel-related foreign exchange payments for the current year, with further allocations based on market conditions.

Diplomatic tensions have intensified between #Egypt, Ethiopia, and Somalia following Ethiopia’s announcement of completing the Grand Renaissance Dam, and Egypt’s activation of its joint defense agreement with #Somalia. These developments mark a deepening rift over strategic control in the Horn of Africa.

Ethiopia’s completion of the dam, critical to its national development, has heightened Egypt’s concerns over water security, as the Nile provides nearly all of its freshwater needs. Meanwhile, Egypt’s military involvement in Somalia under the joint defense pact is seen by Ethiopia as a direct threat to its regional interests, particularly with regard to its ambitions to secure access to the #Red_Sea.

Though an all-out military conflict remains unlikely, ongoing tensions could lead to sporadic armed clashes and further diplomatic and media confrontations. A long-term standoff appears to be the most plausible scenario, with the region remaining on edge as each country seeks to secure its strategic interests.

The paintings in the church are original and have been well-preserved due to the dry air and lack of humidity.

To access the church, one must climb a steep cliff with hand and feet holes carved into it. The ascent is considered hazardous and requires both physical strength and mental fortitude.

Stadium, this architectural masterpiece, built between 1970 and 1974, embodies the fusion of Ethiopia’s cultural heritage with modern architectural innovation. Its tent-like concrete shell roof, the Ethiopian Art Nouveau chandelier, and the frescoes inspired by the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela are not merely artistic elements—they are symbols of our collective identity. Yet, this iconic structure is being threatened with destruction, just like many other historic sites across Addis Ababa.

This is not just about buildings—it’s about who we are as a people. To lose these sites is to lose part of our soul, to erase the memories and identities that have shaped us over generations. This destruction is a crime, and the government responsible for it must be held accountable.
We call upon the international community and diplomatic missions in Ethiopia to intervene. The United Nations, UNESCO, and all relevant international organizations must put pressure on the Ethiopian government to halt this systematic destruction. These sites belong not just to us, but to humanity. Addis Ababa is a living museum, and its destruction is a loss for the world.

But we cannot wait for the world to act on our behalf. The citizens of Addis Ababa must not stay silent.
We cannot stand by as our heritage is erased.  We must stand up against this regime and its reckless disregard for our history. It is our duty to defend the legacy of our ancestors, the cultural treasures that define who we are. If we do not act now, there will be nothing left for future generations to inherit.

Now is the time to rally. Let us unite to protect our city, our history, and our identity. This is not just a fight for Addis Ababa—it is a fight for the soul of Ethiopia. Let the government know that we will not allow our past to be wiped away. Let the world hear our cry: 
Our history will not be erased.

The destruction of our city's landmarks is a deliberate attempt to sever our connection to our rich past and is part of a larger agenda to eradicate Addis Ababa’s unique identity. We must not allow this to continue.

The case of the Ibex Lalibela Restaurant serves as a poignant reminder of what is at stake. Situated near the A.A. Stadium, this architectural masterpiece, built between 1970 and 1974, embodies the fusion of Ethiopia’s cultural heritage with modern architectural innovation. Its tent-like concrete shell roof, the Ethiopian Art Nouveau chandelier, and the frescoes inspired by the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela are not merely artistic elements—they are symbols of our collective identity. Yet, this iconic structure is being threatened with destruction, just like many other historic sites across Addis Ababa.

This is not just about buildings—it’s about who we are as a people. To lose these sites is to lose part of our soul, to erase the memories and identities that have shaped us over generations. This destruction is a crime, and the government responsible for it must be held accountable.
We call upon the international community and diplomatic missions in Ethiopia to intervene. The United Nations, UNESCO, and all relevant international organizations must put pressure on the Ethiopian government to halt this systematic destruction. These sites belong not just to us, but to humanity. Addis Ababa is a living museum, and its destruction is a loss for the world.

But we cannot wait for the world to act on our behalf. The citizens of Addis Ababa must not stay silent.
We cannot stand by as our heritage is erased.  We must stand up against this regime and its reckless disregard for our history. It is our duty to defend the legacy of our ancestors, the cultural treasures that define who we are. If we do not act now, there will be nothing left for future generations to inherit.

Now is the time to rally. Let us unite to protect our city, our history, and our identity. This is not just a fight for Addis Ababa—it is a fight for the soul of Ethiopia. Let the government know that we will not allow our past to be wiped away. Let the world hear our cry: 
Our history will not be erased.

However, Israel had intel about this attack and advised civilians to exit  to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. 

But a short while later, Israelis received an official notice saying they could come out of the shelters. Israel still suffered some casualties. As some Iranian guy were caught on CCTV gunning down civilians.

This is why they impeached Trump as soon as he started digging into where the money was going in Ukraine. Trump did not commit any crime. All he did was get too close to finding out what was going on.

And now if Trump does win the election and does negotiate an end to conflict and the end the flow of money, as he claims, then the public will see that Trump is the peacekeeper, and the Biden regime were the ones who instigated this war.

And one of the stipulations Putin will demand in order to come to an agreement, will include a full-scale UN security council investigation of US bioweapon development in Ukraine. Putin and his military have been demanding it at the UN for years now, and the US veto every attempt. Given RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard have been extremely vocal about this subject, it’s very likely if Trump wins, that his administration will not only agree with Putin in this regard, but assist him in exposing and resolving this threat to humanity.

This is what’s at stake. This is why the Dems seeing Trump talking to Zelensky is their worst nightmare.

I watched flames consume my home and saw limbs and pieces of flesh scattered, I saw bodies nearing death, and finally dying. 

I saw streems of blood oozed from our neighbor's fingers as he desperately held his stomach to keep it from spilling out, and the girl, her tongue sliced by shrapnel, lay in a pool of blood. She did not cry. 

In every terrified child from a war zone, I see myself, and nothing shocks me anymore—I have seen it all.

#Afghanistan has endured over 40 years of relentless bombings. I was one of the millions at the receiving end of the hell that opened upon our land. The masters of the hell had no mercy.  

Yet, kudos to us — we still find the strength to love, show kindness, empathize, and even laugh and celebrate!

Today, a message from a random stranger reminded me that I am no less than a magical being.

Iran is very far from Israel and they don't share any border so ground war is impossible so it leaves to Air strike and Navy

Only option left is missile attacks and hit the infrastructure of each other but it won't make much difference since both have good air defence system

This is why they impeached Trump as soon as he started digging into where the money was going in Ukraine. Trump did not commit any crime. All he did was get too close to finding out what was going on.

And now if Trump does win the election and does negotiate an end to conflict and the end the flow of money, as he claims, then the public will see that Trump is the peacekeeper, and the Biden regime were the ones who instigated this war.

And one of the stipulations Putin will demand in order to come to an agreement, will include a full-scale UN security council investigation of US bioweapon development in Ukraine. Putin and his military have been demanding it at the UN for years now, and the US veto every attempt. Given RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard have been extremely vocal about this subject, it’s very likely if Trump wins, that his administration will not only agree with Putin in this regard, but assist him in exposing and resolving this threat to humanity.

I saw streems of blood oozed from our neighbor's fingers as he desperately held his stomach to keep it from spilling out, and the girl, her tongue sliced by shrapnel, lay in a pool of blood. She did not cry.

I don't think so there is direct head on war possible between Iran and Israel

Iran is very far from Israel and they don't share any border so ground war is impossible so it leaves to Air strike and Navy 

That too looks impossible coz there is air space and sea space of Saudi Arabia and Jordan between them.

Only option left is missile attacks and hit the infrastructure of each other but it won't make much difference since both have good air defence system

 According to the IDF, troops silently reached around 1,000 Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon, some of them several kilometers from the border fence, including tunnels and bunkers where the terror group stored weapons. The IDF said the sites were located both inside Lebanese villages, as well as forested areas.
 
 The raids have been carried out since early on in the war, after the IDF said it managed to push back Hezbollah's elite Radwan force from the border area, enabling Israeli commandos to enter Lebanon with almost no detection. There was no direct clashes with Hezbollah operatives amid any of the raids.
 
 According to IDF assessments, some 2,400 Radwan terrorists and another 500 Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists — trained by Radwan — were waiting in southern Lebanon villages to attack Israel in the days after Hamas's October 7 onslaught.
 
 The IDF Northern Command had expected an invasion from Lebanon and bolstered its defenses. In the following weeks, it carried out numerous strikes on Hezbollah operatives and sites along the border, causing the thousands of Radwan terrorists to withdraw several kilometers back.
 
 The raids carried out by the IDF commandos, including combat engineers, sometimes lasted three to four days, according to the military. In all, 200 nights worth of operations had been carried out.
 
 The military showed reporters dozens of weapons, including assault rifles, machine guns, RPGs, anti-tank missiles, explosive devices, mines, mortars, as well as equipment such as walkie-talkies (which did not explode), that had been recovered by the commandos from within Hezbollah tunnels and bunkers.
 
 Military officials said that the recovered weapons were less than 1 percent of what had been found in the Hezbollah sites. Practically, it was difficult for the soldiers to heave back dozens of heavy weapons back to the country through the difficult terrain, but some soldiers still took on the challenge.
 
 The IDF identified that while its commando operations were successful, it was not enough to be able to achieve the new addition to Israel's war goals — returning the displaced residents of the north back to their homes.
 
 Therefore, the IDF launched what it described as ""limited, localized, and targeted raids"" in southern Lebanon, carried out by an entire division, with the goal of demolishing Hezbollah's infrastructure in the border area. 
 
 The operation has much of the same goals as the commando raids, but now the army can be less silent with its activities, and destroy tunnel networks and other sites that normally can't be carried out by small forces that are operating quietly. Previously, the IDF would strike the raided Hezbollah sites from the air after troops had withdrawn. 
 
 Military officials have said they aim for the offensive to be as short as possible, even just a few weeks. There has been no intention by the IDF to remain in southern Lebanon, but instead, it plans to bolster its defenses and surveillance on the border following the ground operation against the terror group, and make sure Hezbollah does not return to the area.",False,None,,1841093966436933979,None,False,False,en,"https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1841089498009960452/pu/img/NIdjbGLTWO4PxLpv.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1841093425619230721/pu/img/e_cSLXWW1nTk08d9.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1841093661875929091/pu/img/IWfqrBJ_go3alBRO.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1841093927706697731/pu/img/YnVfB7O8WBLV6KGH.jpg",None,None,False,None,69,47,320,None,None,None,None,250178637,313743,EnabledWithCount

Naama’s abduction was recorded on the terrorists’ bodycams. Her heart wrenching words, ""I have friends in Palestine"" show how she believed that once they realized she sees the people in Gaza as friends and neighbors they will release her. 

Hamas’ video of Naama being brutally dragged out of a Jeep in Gaza at gunpoint, pulled by the hair, surrounded by a cheering crowd holding AK-47 riffles. Naama was limping, barefoot, with blood around the crotch of her trousers, her hands tied and ankles cut, proved she was severely wounded.

Life is a one-time opportunity. Use it well. Make peace with those willing to make peace with you, and only make war with those who have themselves first made war on you. Britain and America fought Germany and Japan. After the war, the victorious allies were the same people who rebuilt Germany and Japan. 

Scripture says: As far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone-Romans 12:8. 

Only a madman fights because he likes fighting. I am not a madman. People fight for interests. And what are my interests? I have been a public intellectual for the last thirty-one years of my fifty years on Earth. 

In that time, my core values and interests have been that Nigeria must remain one indivisible country and that:

1-Fuel subsidy must go 
2-The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited must be fully privatised and move from state owned to publicly owned
3-The Naira must be floated, and 
4-Power must be devolved from the Federal to the State and Local Governments, to undo the damage done to Nigeria by Major General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi's May 24, 1966, Unification of Assets Decree 34, which ended True Federalism in Nigeria. 

Before I take a political step, I confer with my political leader, former President Jonathan. And we see eye to eye and have the same worldview and national vision.

I was against President Tinubu because when he won the All Progressives Congress on June 8, 2022, he said he would continue from where Buhari stopped. 

I felt dismayed that he would choose the anniversary of Abacha's death to say that he would continue with the policies of Buhari, Abacha's protégé. 

However, since he was sworn in, President Tinubu has demonstrated that he is keeping faith with the progressive ideas of the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, and the late visionary, Kakanfo Moshood Abiola. 

As such, my stance on the President has changed, and I offer him my right hand of fellowship to continue reforming Nigeria and get her to her pre-1966 level of greatness. 

Long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

Located in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, this ancient rock-hewn church stands atop a vertical cliff, perched at an elevation of around 2,580 meters (8,460 feet). It is considered one of the most inaccessible and challenging religious sites to reach in the world.

The construction of rock-hewn churches in Ethiopia has a long history dating back to the 4th century AD, during the time of the Aksumite Empire. These churches were built by carving into solid rock formations, creating impressive architectural masterpieces. The rock-hewn churches served as centers of religious devotion and provided shelter during times of conflict.

Abuna Yemata Guh is believed to have been carved out of the cliff face during the 5th century, making it over 1,500 years old. It is dedicated to Saint Yemata, a legendary Ethiopian saint who is said to have meditated and prayed in this secluded location. The church is named after Abuna (meaning ""father"" in Amharic) Yemata, who was a prominent Ethiopian religious leader.

What makes Abuna Yemata Guh particularly notable is the challenging ascent required to reach it. Pilgrims and visitors must hike up a steep and narrow footpath, navigating rugged terrain and exposed ledges. The ascent involves scrambling up the cliff face, sometimes using ropes for support. This arduous journey symbolizes a spiritual pilgrimage, testing the devotion and commitment of those seeking solace and connection with their faith.

Despite its remote and inaccessible location, Abuna Yemata Guh has attracted attention in recent years as a testament to Ethiopia's rich cultural heritage and architectural prowess. It is not only a place of worship but also a symbol of the enduring faith and determination of the Ethiopian people.

Furthermore, the Tigray region, where Abuna Yemata Guh is situated, has witnessed significant historical and cultural events throughout the centuries. It has been a center of religious and political power, with various empires and kingdoms rising and falling in the region. Today, Tigray is home to a diverse population, including the Tigrayan people, who have their unique language, culture, and traditions.

In recent years, the Tigray region has faced challenging times due to internal conflicts and humanitarian crises, making access to sites like Abuna Yemata Guh more difficult. Nevertheless, the church continues to be a testament to Ethiopia's rich history and the resilience of its people, reminding us of the enduring power of faith and the importance of preserving cultural heritage.",False,None,,1673837658995322885,None,False,False,en,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FzqqZUyXsAApbuc.jpg,None,None,False,None,468,609,7240,None,None,None,None,855481986290524160,12874411,EnabledWithCount

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a former member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front, an organization still classified as a terrorist group by the United States, and current Director of the World Health Organization (WHO), has proposed a contentious initiative. 

https://t.co/XTHWs0PXde

The WHO plans to establish a global enforcement body tasked with penalizing individuals who disseminate content on the Internet that deviates from mainstream narratives.

During a session named ""Disease X,"" Tedros emphasized the necessity for global preparedness and understanding of potential future pandemics. He advocated for the adoption of the WHO's 'Pandemic Agreement' by world leaders, which he believes is crucial for this purpose. 

This agreement, if ratified, would confer extraordinary powers on the WHO over sovereign states. It includes provisions that could potentially curtail free speech and result in the incarceration of individuals accused of spreading what is deemed as 'misinformation' online. This plan has sparked debate over its implications for individual freedoms and national sovereignty.

Former Terrorist Dr Tedros who is not a medical doctor but is a former member of the Tigray Peoples liberation front-a highly violet terrorist organisation and on the proscribed list of banned terror organisations in the US is still under threat of genocide charges.

The puppet who fronts Bill Gates and his dodgy ideologies through the WHO is also accused of corruption with the Chinese Communist Party and has been accused of sexual deviancy.

So just why did they think this man should have access to our medical data?

Well Bill Gates has a lot of money and the politicians in our respective countries just love Bill Gates money.

An American economist nominated for the Nobel peace prize has called for the head of the World Health Organisation to be prosecuted for genocide over his alleged involvement in directing Ethiopia’s security forces.

David Steinman accused Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 55, who took over at the WHO three years ago, of being one of three officials in control of the Ethiopian security services from 2013 to 2015.

Dr Tedros was the country’s health minister from 2005 to 2012 and its foreign minister until 2016, when his Tigray People’s Liberation Front party was the main member of the ruling coalition.

Mr Steinman, an economist and campaigner nominated for the peace prize last year, lodged the complaint at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

He claimed that Dr Tedros “was a crucial decision maker in relation to security service actions that included killing, arbitrarily detaining and torturing Ethiopians”.

Dr Tedros has risen to international prominence as the leader of the UN’s health body during the coronavirus pandemic. He is the organisation’s first leader without medical qualifications.

The complaint to prosecutors at the ICC comes after General Berhanu Jula, Ethiopia’s army chief of staff, called last month for the WHO leader to resign. He accused him of trying to procure weapons for the Tigray region, where the Ethiopian army is fighting local forces.

In his complaint, Mr Steinman pointed to a 2016 US government report on human rights in Ethiopia that found the “civilian authorities at times did not maintain control over the security forces, and local police in rural areas and local militias sometimes acted independently”.

Mr Steinman added that the US report cited “other documented crimes”. He accused Dr Tedros of being involved in the “intimidation of opposition candidates and supporters”, including “arbitrary arrest . . . and lengthy pre-trial detention”.

The complaint also alleged that Dr Tedros oversaw the “killing, and causing serious bodily and mental harm to, members of the Amhara, Konso, Oromo and Somali tribes with intent to destroy those tribes in whole or in part”.

Mr Steinman claimed that during the four years Dr Tedros “co-led” Ethiopia’s government, the regime “was marked by widespread or systematic crimes against humanity by subordinates”. His complaint can proceed only if it is adopted by prosecutors at The Hague court, which is independent of the UN. If they do, it would be the first prosecution of a senior UN figure.

Mr Steinman, a former consultant to the US National Security Council, was a senior foreign adviser to Ethiopia’s democracy movement for 27 years until its victory in 2018 under Abiy Ahmed Ali, the current prime minister.

Dr Tedros has denied the allegations and any wrongdoing. He issued a statement last month regarding the current situation in Tigray. “There have been reports suggesting I am taking sides in this situation,” he said. “This is not true and I want to say that I am on only one side and that is the side of peace.”

Recent interviews conducted at Walta TV Zerihun said that Somalia lacks sovereignty over northern Somalia and contended that the British granted them an autonomous entity known as ""Somaliland."" He cited certain tribes that had agreements with the British colonizers, but he neglected to include the many others that rejected such agreements and resisted colonization.

Teshome said that Ethiopia is not infringing on Somalia's sovereignty; rather, we are working in accord with ""Somaliland."" He likened the situation to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, emphasizing that the recognition of ""Somaliland"" is not about creating a new nation but acknowledging its pre-existing independence.

Mr. Teshome said that only Mogadishu is contesting the MOU, whereas Garowe and Baidabo are not in opposition. Moreover, he mentioned that President Hassan Sheikh of Somalia is arming and equipping his clan for a specific purpose, and he characterized the existing government as only nominal in its function.

He accused Hassan Sheikh and the Somali governments of supporting and founding SSC-Khatumo. He also claimed that Al-Shabaab is involved in SSC-Khatumo's creation, stated that ISIS is in the Sanaag highlands, and mentioned Daesh's presence in Bosaso. The incorrect claim that Sool is located next to Ferfer, near the Ethiopian border, weakens the argument's credibility due to geographical inaccuracies.

He stated that four former Ethiopian governments failed to annex the Somali Ocean. However, he believes this current government will achieve full sovereignty of the 20km region, allowing the Ethiopian navy to establish a permanent base. He emphasized that the people in ""Somaliland""'s desire supports their claim, making it easier to establish Ethiopian sovereignty over the land.

You can get the impression from listening to his speech that this former lackey of the TPLF has been persuaded to insult the Somali government and designate certain regions as terrorist areas. Ethiopians have been fighting for an ocean since their king Dawit II, and now they feel that Ethiopia can finally have access to the blue ocean by using these useful idiots. This is more like a pretext to find a way to start war, helping those weak and malnourished militias known as ""somaliland,"" which were known to be enemies' collaborators for their grandfathers when the British invaded Somalia.@SSCKhaatumo @TheVillaSomalia @AhmedMoFiqi @SomaliPM @AbukarOsman1 @UNSomalia",False,None,,1842264782847574486,None,False,False,en,https://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1842264135418933248/img/ap5CUimOsmP4bNM4.jpg,None,None,False,None,0,0,0,None,None,None,None,1026442766535020544,95,EnabledWithCount

In this commentary, Alemayehu Diro, an expert in Economics and Social Anthropology, addresses the cultural significance of Andoodee Tumaa, a sacred site tied to the #Gadaa system of the #Oromo people. The author highlights the diminishing ritual space of Andoodee Tumaa, emphasizing the need for preservation efforts by the Oromia government and relevant institutions.

Andoodee Tumaa holds a vital role in the Gadaa law-making process, which culminates at this site every eight years. The area, located in the Akaki district, has faced encroachment due to the expansion of #Addis_Abeba City. This expansion, initiated without the consent of the surrounding Oromo community, poses a threat to the cultural and political importance of the site. 

The commentary delves into the cultural and historical narratives surrounding Andoodee Tumaa, including its connection to Oromo mythology and the symbolic rituals performed at this location. These rituals are closely linked to other sites, such as Malkaa Bulchaa and Abdarii Kushuluu, which have also suffered from environmental degradation and encroachment. 

Alemayehu calls on the Oromia government, particularly the Oromia Tourism Commission, to take action in preserving Andoodee Tumaa and other significant ritual sites, ensuring their continuity within the Oromo cultural heritage. He stresses that these sites are not only important for their historical and cultural value but are integral to the Oromo people’s identity and governance system.

'Sefu' is where social order is expected among Oromos. Personality traits: Attitudes and behavior. Sefu is a social concept that separates what is shameful from what is not. It is the basis of the Oromo community; that is, it is possible! 

In this sociological conception, there is an unwritten but known law of what a healthy interaction of people with society should look like. A system has been set for how the powerful should use their power and how the powerful should help the weak. In this sense, it is a broad consciousness. 

The Oromo Sefu believes that Waqa, the creator of all, is the law of social order given to human beings since the world's creation. In ancient Oromo society belief, it is believed that every creature has its ayyaana (spirit). Thus, each creature (human, animal, plant, etc.) has distinguishing characteristics. When the creator created the earth, he made laws for man to live in order. These laws are called the law of man, the law of cattle, the law of horses, the law of wild animals, the law of plants, and the law of the sun and stars. 

""Sefu"" is an immutable law of the creator. This includes killing, stealing, adultery, and lying, which are forbidden. Respecting the Creator, the Earth, and all other creatures is to respect the Law of the Creator. Prohibitions are enacted to protect the so-called 'legitimate' activities of society. A person is said to have committed a sin when he violates/transgresses these laws and prohibitions of the Creator. 

Sefu is a scale. The great and the small, the rich and the poor, and the enslaver and the enslaved are equal to each other. Sefu is a balance, but that doesn't mean it puts everyone on an equal footing. The landing zone is separated by weight. Sefu is not an idea that allows the joining and merging of two sides. 

In the Oromo community, people are measured by their Sefu. Respecting elders, respecting and obeying parents, etc., is widespread. It is said that they are vast when faced with issues beyond the human mind. Sefu is not a single idea that can be defined in one sentence. When Oromo says something like ""safuu dha"" (it is Sefu), it has many meanings. 

One can use sefu to express surprise, fear, pain, sadness, or shame. ""Oromoon safuu qaba."" It is said to express this idea.",False,None,,1841227996167897256,None,False,False,en,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY1bGoOXwAQSWuR.jpg,None,None,False,None,0,0,6,None,None,None,None,1347911156170686469,988,EnabledWithCount
