Our position is that if any African country is willing to regain their independence from external forces and seek our help, we will give them our full support.” (Paraphrased) 

Heard this from one of Putin’s interviews on RT.  There’s an African adage that says, “a word is enough for the wise.” 

Take it from me, the newly regained independence of the Sahel states (Mali, Burkina-Faso & Niger) is cast on stone. Forget the silly assassination attempts. It won’t work. Like I’ve said repeatedly in my videos, what you need to break the will of a bully like colonial Europe is a super power like Russia. If Russia was this active in Africa years ago, we wouldn’t have lost Gaddafi. But they’re here now. Expect more African states to break free, despite the massive geopolitical reset that the freaked out colonial forces have embarked on in Africa since losing the Sahel states. More African countries will be free. Take it to the bank and cash it.

Today should symbolize our freedom, but does it?
Have we really been free?

Since our heroes past celebrated on 1st October 1960, have Nigerians ever celebrated a true Independence?
The first and last day that a 64 years old celebrated was the day of his birth, isn’t that a calamity?

Just today, while the nation waves its green and white flags, peaceful protesters who dared to call for a better Nigeria were met with tear gas and brutality from the State, and only recently, in August, others were killed for asking for a better Nigeria free from hunger. And let us not forget October 20, 2020, one of the darkest days in our history, when peaceful protesters seeking justice and an end to police brutality were brutally murdered in the same month we celebrate freedom. So Nigeria, when have we ever been free?

The wealth of this blessed Nation remains concentrated in the hands of a few, while millions suffer and die.
And the leaders call that Independence.

Today Nigeria is not free. In Nigeria, Bandits celebrate independence, Terrorist celebrate independence, insecurity celebrate independence, kidnappers are very much independent, corruption celebrates the biggest independence while the people cry for help.

As we mark our independence today, we mark the failure of our leaders.
We mark the betrayal of the hopes and dreams of Nigerians.
A betrayal to the Nigeria of our dreams.

Our leaders have driven us into poverty, leaving us with nothing but hope.
Hope they constantly try to crush, but then claim that they renew.
Yet, in the face of these challenges, we continue to rise. Our spirit unbroken, and our belief in a better Nigeria is standing strong.
This hope they try to crush, we have kept it alive.

Today, I say Happy Independence to Nigeria, not because we are truly free, but because I believe in the resilience of our people. Despite the challenges, despite the terrible leaders, we have not given up.

We are a nation of dreamers, fighters, and believers of a great future, of true independence. Until then, we will continue to speak up, demand better, and to strive for the Nigeria we all deserve.
